## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas
1. **RSS Feed Reliability**: 78 feeds from various sources may have inconsistent formats
   - *Mitigation*: Robust error handling, feed validation, fallback mechanisms
   
2. **AI Classification Accuracy**: Content classification may produce false positives/negatives
   - *Mitigation*: Confidence scoring, manual override capability, continuous training

3. **Performance at Scale**: Large datasets may impact response times
   - *Mitigation*: Database indexing, caching strategy, pagination, query optimization

4. **Migration Complexity**: Preserving existing feed configurations during migration
   - *Mitigation*: Parallel run period, comprehensive testing, rollback plan

### Medium-Risk Areas
1. **API Rate Limits**: OpenAI/Anthropic API quotas may be exceeded
   - *Mitigation*: Rate limiting, request queuing, multiple API key rotation

2. **Database Scaling**: PostgreSQL performance under heavy load
   - *Mitigation*: Connection pooling, read replicas, query optimization

3. **User Adoption**: Stakeholders may resist interface changes
   - *Mitigation*: User involvement in design, training, gradual rollout
